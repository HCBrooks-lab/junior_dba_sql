## Project Context
This project was created to strengthen my understanding of how databases are structured, maintained, and optimized in support of analytics and reporting. It reflects hands-on practice with SQL and core database concepts, with an emphasis on improving data quality, query performance, and collaboration with database administrators.

## How This Repository is Used
- Reinforce relational database concepts that support analytics wrk
- Practice writing clear, well-documented SQL
- Build awareness of database performance & maintenance considerations
- Serve as a growing reference alongside analytics-focused projects

## Skills Demonstrated
- Writing SELECT queries with filtering, joins, and aggregations
- Understanding table relationships & keys
- Basic database administration concepts
- Query readability & structure

## Scope of This Repository
This repository focuses on foundational SQL and database administration concepts commonly expected at the junior level. The goal is to demonstrate understanding of database structure, querying logic, and best practices through clear, readable examples.

## Notes
All examples are intended for learning and demonstration purposes. Scripts may have comments examples explaining database concepts rather than production-ready implementations.
